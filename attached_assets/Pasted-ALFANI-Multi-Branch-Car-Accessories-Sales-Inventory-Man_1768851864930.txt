ALFANI – Multi-Branch Car Accessories Sales & Inventory Management System
System Overview

ALFANI is a centralized sales and inventory management system designed specifically for car accessories retail businesses operating across multiple branches. The platform enables unified customer and sales management while maintaining strict separation of inventory between branches.
