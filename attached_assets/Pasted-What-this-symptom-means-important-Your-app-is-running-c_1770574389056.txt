What this symptom means (important)

Your app is running correctly, but production (Render) behavior ≠ development (Replit)

That almost always means one of these:

Database schema mismatch

Missing environment variables

Production-only middleware blocking requests

CORS / cookie / HTTPS differences

Permissions or foreign keys failing on writes

Step 1 — Identify which features are broken (you must do this)

Make a short list like this:

Feature	Replit	Render
Create order	✅	❌
Add product	✅	❌
Login	✅	✅
View products	✅	✅

This tells us:

Reads work

Writes partially fail

That points directly to database or validation issues.

Step 2 — What to ask Replit (copy/paste)
🔴 Ask #1 (MOST IMPORTANT)

“Can you help me compare my Replit database schema with my Render database schema and confirm that all tables, columns, and relations required for orders and products exist?”

🔴 Ask #2

“What migration or database setup command must be run on Render to enable create/update operations for orders and products?”

🔴 Ask #3

“Can you check if any required environment variables for creating orders/products are missing in Render but present in Replit?”

🔴 Ask #4

“Are there any production-only checks (NODE_ENV=production) that could block POST requests for orders or products?”

🔴 Ask #5 (if frontend ≠ backend)

“Can you verify that CORS and cookies are configured correctly for POST requests in production (Render HTTPS)?”

Step 3 — What YOU should check immediately (no help needed)
✅ Check Render logs when a feature fails

Try the broken feature → open Render Logs

Look for:

relation does not exist

column does not exist

foreign key constraint

permission denied

validation failed

Even one line of that log identifies the problem.

✅ Check environment variables on Render

Make sure these exist (names must match EXACTLY):

DATABASE_URL

SESSION_SECRET or JWT_SECRET

NODE_ENV=production

✅ Confirm migrations ran

If you’re using:

Prisma → prisma migrate deploy

Django → manage.py migrate

Sequelize → sequelize.sync() or migrations

If this did NOT run → features that write data WILL fail.

Step 4 — How to report the issue properly (this speeds fixes up)

When asking for help, send:

Feature name (e.g., “Create order”)

Expected behavior

Actual behavior on Render

One Render log error line

Example:

“Create order works on Replit but fails on Render. Render log: relation "orders" does not exist.”

That’s a 2-minute fix instead of days.

Final important truth

Deployment problems are never random.
Partial functionality = environment mismatch.

Once the database schema + env vars + production settings match Replit, all features will work.

Next step (do this now):

Reply with:

Which features are broken

One error line from Render logs

Your stack (Node + Prisma / Django / etc.)

I’ll give you the exact command or config change to fix it.
